**Questions & Answers:**

1. How does maintaining updated packages illustrate complete mediation?
Maintaining updated packages ensures that every component of the system is continuously checked and updated to address any known vulnerabilities or security flaws. By keeping all packages up-to-date, we ensure that no outdated or vulnerable software remains in the environment, supporting the principle of complete mediation. This process of applying patches and updates acts as a security control that verifies all components of the system are functioning within their expected and secure states, thus preventing unauthorized access or exploitation through unpatched vulnerabilities.

2. Why is generating a new SBOM after patching essential to assurance?’
Generating a new SBOM after patching is essential because it provides an updated, comprehensive list of all installed software components, confirming that all patches have been applied successfully and that no additional or outdated software has been left behind. This ensures transparency and helps verify the integrity of the system. The SBOM acts as a critical tool in the assurance process by validating that the system’s software environment is up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities, which is key to maintaining a secure and trusted system.

3. What risks persist when organizations delay system updates?
When organizations delay system updates, they expose their environments to a range of security risks, including the exploitation of known vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are often publicly disclosed and actively targeted by attackers. Delayed updates can lead to system compromises, data breaches, and loss of trust in the organization’s security posture. Additionally, outdated software may lack critical bug fixes, performance improvements, and compatibility updates, which can further weaken the system's stability and reliability.

4. How does this exercise embody the secure design lifecycle principle?
This exercise embodies the secure design lifecycle principle by demonstrating continuous monitoring and improvement of the system's security through SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, and patching. The secure design lifecycle emphasizes ongoing validation and assurance of security at every stage of a system’s life, not just during initial development. By regularly assessing and updating the system environment, as shown in this exercise, we ensure that security remains an integral part of the system throughout its operational lifetime, minimizing risks and maintaining a trusted environment.
